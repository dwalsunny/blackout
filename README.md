# Blackout

Blackout is an Android mobile application that aggregates all your drunk texts and social media activity from your night out, and conveniently presents them to you in one timeline.

This project was a component of the Spring 2016 offering of ECE 452 (Software Design & Architecture) at the University of Waterloo.
